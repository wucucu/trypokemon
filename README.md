This repo is inspired by the dataset [pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) on kaggle. I will try to do some EDA, ML algorithms and visualizations based on the dataset.

## [ ] Prepare the pictures

TBH, I am not huge fan of Pok√©mon while Pikachu might be the only pokemon specie I know. So the plan now is to scrap each specie's pictures. Try to use scrapy.

## [ ] Simple EDA



## [ ] Try Docker
