This repo is inspired by the dataset [pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) on kaggle. I will try to do some EDA, ML algorithms and visualizations based on the dataset.

## [ ] Prepare the pictures

TBH, I am not a huge fan of Pok√©mon while Pikachu might be the only pokemon specie I know. So the plan now is to scrap each specie's picture. Try to use [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) and scrap data from [pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/).

First I tried to use `conda` to set up the python environment as the default python3 version on my mac is 3.5. I thought I installed `miniconda` before while not. I spent quite a while and realized the current mac `conda` installation conflicts with `on-my-zsh`, and I am not able to deal with bash scripts. So I decide to try to either install python3.7 or set up docker.

Life is easy = = why we need conda = =
```sh
python3.7 -m venv .env
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirement
```

## [ ] Simple EDA



## [ ] Try Docker
